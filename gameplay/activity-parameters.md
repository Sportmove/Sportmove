# ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· Activity parameters

To track your sport activity, we have developed our in-app tracker where the user has to manually start and end the activity. We will use GPS, motion sensor, gyroscope and heart rate (BPM) to accurately track your activity data. And these actions should be done outdoors for better GPS connection. After practicing sports, we will show you data about:

* Heart rate (BPM)
* Distance&#x20;
* Speed&#x20;
* Earnings&#x20;
* Ranges
* Oxygen level\
