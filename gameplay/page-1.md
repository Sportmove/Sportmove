# ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Energy System

After purchasing the NFT T-SHIRT, you will receive a daily energy that will determine the maximum time available for which you can practice sport and win. Once your energy runs out, you won't be able to gain anything, although you can continue your activity.

In the closed beta phase of the app, you will receive 30 energy points daily, which is basically 30 minutes of training (1 energy = 1 min). Energy will be given to you at various intervals - 10 energy for every SPORT you have every 8 hours. If you want more energy, you can rebuy for more energy at the price of 20 SPORT for 30 energy. Only 1 rebuy is allowed per day for each SPORT you own.
