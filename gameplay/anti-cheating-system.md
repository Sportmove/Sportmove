# ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Anti-Cheating System

We provide three ways to stop cheating during the game, where the cheater will suffer severe punishments. The following mechanics will be used:

* GPS tracking.
* Sensing health and movement data.
* Explanation of the machinery in order to detect cheating through data simulations.

Any violation of the device's root code will result in a blockage of Sportmove, in which there will be a discrepancy in your functioning.

Transferring a T-shirt from one account to another will cause the T-shirt to enter a freeze period, during which time users will not be able to use their T-shirt.\
\
If energy is lost during the process of transferring the T-shirt from the inventory to the wallet, all unopened mystery boxes from the T-shirt account will be burned.

Note that wasting power listing a T-shirt on the market will not burn out the mystery boxes.
