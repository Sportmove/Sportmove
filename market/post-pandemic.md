# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± Post pandemic

It's been almost two years with events that did not have an audience, in addition to championships paralyzed by several months and adaptations that no one I expected to have to pass.

To maintain their activities, clubs, federations, athletes and communication vehicles reinvented themselves and sought to alternatives, but that did not prevent the sudden drop in revenue.

Now, with the possible return of the public to competitions in 2022, companies are already moving to get ahead and win the affection of the fans through investment in sports marketing and, consequently, increase revenue.

We firmly believe that the implementation of the SPORTMOVE project as an innovative technological platform for products, services, sports marketing and entertainment and the adoption of the token as a digital currency of utility, will efficiently increase the flow of capital, reducing the barriers that make negotiations difficult, funding and attracting investments for clubs, associations and companies in the sports in general and sports entertainment.
